**NOTE:** Warewolf is currently under going some major code changes as well as a [Studio redesign](http://warewolf.io/ESB-blog/big-ui-changes-coming-to-warewolf-studio/). For that reason we have set the default branch to development-stable as it the last stable point in the code base before the overhaul began. Please use that branch if you need a stable build. If you want to see how things are progressing with the redesign feel free to grab the development branch.

**What is Warewolf ESB all about?**
