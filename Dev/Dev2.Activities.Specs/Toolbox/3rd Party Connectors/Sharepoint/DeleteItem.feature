Feature: DeleteItemFromList
	In order to delete an item from a Sharepoint List
	As a Warewolf User
	I want a tool that will allow be to provide criteria to find and item 
	  and map the number of found items to the result
	  and delete the found  items from the Sharepoint List

Scenario: Delete Item from list with no criteria
	Given I have a sharepoint source to "http://rsaklfsvrsharep/"
	And I select "AcceptanceTesting" list
	And I map the list input fields as
	| Field Name | Variable           |
	| Name       | [[items(*).name]]  |
	| Title      | [[items(*).title]] |
	And I have a variable "[[items(1).name]]" with value "Created From Warewolf"
	And I have a variable "[[items(1).title]]" with value "My New Warewolf Acceptance Test Item"
	And I have a variable "[[items(2).name]]" with value "Created From Warewolf 2"
	And I have a variable "[[items(2).title]]" with value "My New Warewolf Acceptance Test Item 2"
	#And I have a variable "[[items(3).name]]" with value "Created From Warewolf 3"
	#And I have a variable "[[items(3).title]]" with value "My New Warewolf Acceptance Test Item 3"
	And I have result variable as "[[Result]]"
	When the sharepoint create list item tool is executed
	And the activity is cleared
	When the sharepoint delete item from list tool is executed
	Then the value of "[[Result]]" equals "2"
	And the execution has "NO" error
	And the debug output as 
	|                                             |
	| [[Result]] = 2 |
